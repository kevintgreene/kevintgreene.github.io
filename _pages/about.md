I am an Academic Research Manager in the Empirical Studies of Conflict project at Princeton University leading the [Digital Conflict and Information Integrity](https://esoc.princeton.edu/projects/digital-conflict-and-information-integrity) project. Previously I served as a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Computer Science Department at Dartmouth College. I earned my Ph.D. in Political Science from the University of Pittsburgh. 

I use data science techniques such as machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) to study the role of information and information communication technologies (ICT) in international and domestic politics. Ongoing projects investigate the social and political risks posed by generative AI, the strategies employed by foreign influence operations, and the spread of unreliable content from algorithmic recommendations.


My research has been funded by the National Science Foundation, Lockheed Martin Advanced Technology Labs  Microsoft, and Google and published in the *Science Advances*, *PNAS Nexus*, *American Political Science Review*, *Political Analysis*, the *Journal of Politics*, and *Political Communication* among others. I have also published in popular media outlets such as *Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists*, *Vox* and *Political Violence at a Glance* and had an article selected as one of [“The Five Best Ideas Today”](https://time.com/3944498/americas-very-own-greece/) by Time Magazine/Aspen Institute.
